##Employee Management System
#Overview
The Employee Management System is a C++ project designed to streamline employee management tasks such as attendance tracking, leave requests, and notifications. The project uses fundamental data structures like hash tables, queues, and singly linked lists to implement key features.

#Features
Employee Attendance Management:

Record clock-in and clock-out times for employees.
Maintain attendance records using a singly linked list.
Leave Request Handling:

Employees can request leaves.
Leave requests are managed using a queue.
Notification System:

Send notifications to employees using a hash table.
Reports:

Generate attendance reports.
Generate leave request reports.

Classes and Functionality
1. request and Queues
request:
Represents a leave request with fields for id, description, and status.
Methods:
GetRequest()
print()
Overloaded = operator.
Queues:
Implements a queue to store request objects.
Methods:
Enqueue()
Dequeue()
print()
isEmpty()
2. Manager
Handles employee management tasks:
Attendance:
clockIn()
clockOut()
Leave Requests:
requestLeave()
ManageLeaveRequests()
Reports:
generateAttendanceReport()
generateLeaveRequestsReport()
3. Singly_Linked_list
Implements a singly linked list to store attendance records.
Methods include:
Insertions (insertFirst, insertLast, insertAt)
Deletions (deleteFirst, deleteLast, deleteAt, deleteElm)
Utility functions (reverse, clear, printelem)
4. HashTable
Implements a hash table to store employee data and send notifications.
Allows chaining to handle collisions.
Compilation and Execution
To compile the program:

bash
Copy
Edit
g++ main.cpp HashTable.cpp Manager.cpp Queues.cpp SinglyLinkedList.cpp -o main
To run the program:

bash
Copy
Edit
./main
Example Usage
Employees clock in/out, request leaves, and receive notifications.
Attendance and leave request reports are generated and saved.
The program processes and handles all employee data efficiently using custom data structures.
Future Improvements
Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user interaction.
Store data persistently using file I/O or integrate with a database.
Improve error handling and validation for edge cases.
